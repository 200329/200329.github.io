										<h3>Tips to on Buying Pianos</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>First of all, a piano can last a long time.  Like 40 years long.  Longer than probably your furniture and car.  So don't try to save money or buy a cheap brand just because of the cost, because since they last a long time, if you think you will be making that commitment, buying a good one at the very beginning is a good idea.</li>
											<li>Size also matters a lot.  How much space will you have for your piano?  Pianos tend to have better sound the larger it is, because of the larger vibration, but how much space can you afford?  If you want a good concert grand, it is 5 ft to 9 ft, and will also cost signifigantly more.  If you are choosing from a mediocre grand and a good upright, choose the upright, it is much smaller and still produces fine sound.</li>
											<li>Style - Choose a piano that fits with your home styling.  Look at the legs and music rack to see how compatible it is to your home.  However, don't treat a piano like a piece of furniture.  Always consider buying a new piano, because unlike a piece of antique furniture, for example, a piano doesn't have good sound after maybe 50 years.  If you buy an old piano, only buy it for decoration and not for sound.</li>
											<li>Ask questions - When buying a piano, always inspect it to see if it is in good condition, and ask about its state. Look at the back, soundboard, strings, hammers, keys, and the cabinet to see if it is in a good shape</li>
											<li>Buying a piano is an investment.  It does cost a lot of money, but it will last you for a long time.  Also, pianos depreciate very little, so in the end, the value doesn't decrease by a large percentage.  However, remember to take care of it, checking the temperature, humidity, dusting, as well as tuning.  There will sometimes be a complimentary tuning service, but check with your provider.  Tune at least twice a year</li>

											<p>Sometimes looking at so many brands of pianos can be overwhelming.  I mean, how can there be so many choices?  There are thousands of brands, each one with a distinct sound - It would be good for you to are you supposed to just look through all of them?</p>
